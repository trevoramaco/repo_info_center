# Repo Information Center

Welcome to my GitHub! This GitHub follows a set of conventions to make it easier to find relevant code. The primary conventions relate to `Repository Name` and `Topic Tags`.

Use these conventions to search for relevant code easily!

## Topic Tags

Repositories are tagged with the following:
* Languages Used
* Frameworks Used
* Relevant Tools/Integrations (ex: ServiceNow, Meraki, etc.)

## Repository Names

Repository names follow a convention of `[prefix]`.`[repo_name]`, where `prefix` is determined based on the following simple logic. The goal is maximum 'at a glance' specificity, so prefixes are chosen based on how a project can ultimately be stilled down. See the `Current Prefix Table` for all the current prefixes!

### Logic
1. Primary Language or Framework (ex: `Go`, `Django`, `Node`)
2. Library (ex: `FastAPI`)
3. Concept or Industry (ex: `Machine Leaning`, `Full Stack`, `Mobile`)
4. Project Grouping or some other Group Identifier (ex: `Portfolio Site`)

**Note**: Certain Prefixes don't follow this logic. See `Special Prefixes`. 

### Current Prefix Table

| Prefix | Explanation |   
| :---:   | :---: |
| `django` | Django Framework |
| `flask` | Flask Framework |
| `go` | Go Language |
| `unity` | Unity Language |

### Special Prefixes

* `portfolio`: primary portfolio projects
* `certification`: code related to certification preparation (typically `private`)
* `interview`: code related to a job interview (typically `private`)
* `[company_name]`: code related to and publicly published while I worked at the specific company. The current list includes:
  * `cisco`: Cisco Systems
* `misc`: random, no better classification
